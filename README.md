## Overview

**NueraNet-SOC** is an ambitious personal project designed to showcase expertise in cybersecurity, AI integration, and solutions architecture. This homelab simulates a miniature enterprise security environment, featuring a SOC for threat monitoring, a penetration testing suite for ethical hacking, and AI agents to automate and enhance security workflows. Initially built on a single host with VMware virtualization, itâ€™s designed to scale up with advanced hardware (e.g., NVIDIA DGX) for deeper AI capabilities.

### Goals
- Build a functional SOC with AI-driven threat detection and reporting.
- Automate penetration testing workflows using AI agents.
- Create a modular, scalable architecture documented via GitHub.
- Serve as a portfolio piece for transitioning into cybersecurity and solutions architect roles.

### Current Hardware
- **Host OS**: Parrot OS (Linux-based, security-focused)
- **RAM**: 32GB
- **Storage**: 1TB free
- **CPU**: Core i7 (multi-core with hyper-threading)
- **Virtualization**: VMware Workstation Pro

### Future Vision
Scale to enterprise-grade networking hardware and clustered servers as well as advanced computers for AI (e.g., NVIDIA DGX) to integrate deep learning models for advanced threat analysis.

## Architecture

The homelab consists of multiple VMs, each serving a distinct role, connected via a virtual network:

1. **SOC VM**  
   - **Purpose**: Centralized monitoring and threat detection.  
   - **Tools**: Wazuh (SIEM), Python-based AI anomaly detection.  
   - **AI Agent**: Analyzes logs and network traffic for anomalies.

2. **Penetration Testing VM**  
   - **Purpose**: Simulate ethical hacking and vulnerability scanning.  
   - **Tools**: Parrot OS (or Kali Linux), Metasploit, Nmap.  
   - **AI Agent**: Automates attack scripting and result analysis.

3. **Target VM**  
   - **Purpose**: Vulnerable system for testing attacks.  
   - **Tools**: Metasploitable, DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web App).

4. **AI Agent Controller VM**  
   - **Purpose**: Coordinates AI agents across the homelab.  
   - **Tools**: Python, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Flask API.

5. **Network Simulation VM**  
   - **Purpose**: Simulates network routing and firewalling.  
   - **Tools**: pfSense.
